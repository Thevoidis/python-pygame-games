# bigtower

A tower defense game

# Notice :
shifting the base to pygame from arcade

Save data is stored in

# TODO :

## Pending
[ ] Write the engine

[ ] Make a Text Box Class that parses markdown to scrollable text

[ ] Make the layout for the career screen (options on the left, stats on the right)
    [ ] Options are : (graphics, back to main menu)

[ ] Make the campaign screen (campaigns levels on the left, upgrades on the right)
[ ] Make the options menu (add a recursive stack for layered menus)

## Done
[✓] Figure out how to get mouse click to work on the menus
[✓] Make an input field class for the username and other things that you might need

# Plan :

## General Plan ;

- I think I'll make it a tower defense game with randomly generated maps and routes.
- The towers will need to be right clickable(for upgrades and the like), and the ground will also need to be right clickable (for building towers)
- The enemies will walk through the paths, increasing in strength with the duration of the game
- Gold will be required to build and upgrade towers, and killing enemies will yield gold.
- The towers will have different kinds of firepower, which can also be upgraded and deleted if needed.
- Samrik says to add a king to the base who can be ejected in an emergency. Ejecting the king means that the player can no longer build or upgrade the towers until the king goes back to base, but the king can move around and attack targets (controlled by the player)

## The engine :
In general , the engine's job is to get the position of the towers and to run the scripts attached to each tower. It is also responsible for guiding enemies to the player base.

- I will need to make a class of unit, from which all other units are descended from. The engine will affect all units equally. If the unit is able to move, it will move towards the nearest enemy. Also , if it is able to attack, it will attack as soon as it is in range of a valid target.

I still do not know if there is a need for a whole engine for this.
Depending on how much work is relegated to the engine, it will either be too trivial or too complicated, nothing in between.
But I guess I will do it anyways.
also, since we will be dealing with a lot of units, it might be wise to write the engine in C




## Directory structure :
- menus/        # This directory will have menus and the welcome screen. Accessing the options menu pauses the game.
- engine/       # This one houses the game mechanics
- maps/         # The game is meant to be reused with different maps, so this is for the maps
- units/        # This is where units (like towers and enemies are stored)
    - units/towers  # Towers
    - units/enemies # Enemies
    - units/base    # Base
- ui_elements/  # These are the game UI elements (accessed by right clicking towers and locations on maps). These are handled separately from menus, and accessing them doesn't pause the game.
- assets/       # images, sounds, etc
